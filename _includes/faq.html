                        WHERE IS IT?<br>

                        WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?<br>
                        All undergraduate & graduate students of any skill level, from any discipline!<br><br>
                        HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?<br>
                        Nothing! Food, refreshments & prizes have been graciously provided by our sponsors.<br><br>
                        HOW LARGE CAN TEAMS BE?<br>
                        Anywhere from 1 to 4 people.<br><br>
                        SO I CAN GO IT ALONE?<br>
                        It's up to you, but each member of the winning team receives their individual own prize. So you only have something to gain by joining a team!<br><br>
                        DO I HAVE TO HAVE A TEAM?<br>
                        Nope! But it is your responsibility to network with other people to find a team.<br><br>
                        IF I WIN ALONE, CAN I HORDE THE PRIZES?<br>
                        Sorry, but no. Each member of the winning teams recieves a pre-determined prize package. Don't be greedy!<br><br>
                        DO WINNING TEAMS SPLIT PRIZES?<br>
                        No! Each member of the winning team receives their own prize. That means you only have something to gain by joining a team and getting to work. Go for it!<br><br>
                        HOW DO I GET THERE?<br>
                        We can reimburse a $100 for travel, but if your school can fill a bus, let us know!<br><br>
                        WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE TO COMPETE. CAN I STILL ATTEND?<br>
                        The most important thing is that you're there, have fun and learn something. Go ahead and register and make the most out of it. It's complete free so there's nothing to lose!<br><br>
                        DOES MINNEHACK PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION?<br>
                        Buses will be provided from certain schools. <br><br>
                        DO I HAVE TO BRING MY OWN COMPUTER?<br>
                        Yes. We cannot provide computers for everyone. So please bring along a machine for you and your team to work on.
