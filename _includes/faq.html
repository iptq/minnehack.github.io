      You can create your own team ahead of time if you'd like, or
      meet and greet new people and form a team at the event! Teams
      will consist of 1-4 undergraduate, graduate, or high school students
      of any skill level and any discipline, but all are judged on the same
      grounds, so the more the merrier!

      your ideas!

      Thanks to our wonderful sponsors, MinneHack
      is <strong>completely free!</strong> We will provide food,
      drinks, internet, entertainment, swag from our sponsors, and
      even a sleeping area, so all you
      have to worry about is the coding.

      <h6>What do I need to bring?</h6>

      You'll need to bring yourself and a computer! A more
      comprehensive list of things will be sent to you before the
      event, but we also recommend:

      <ul>
        <li>Phone</li>
        <li>Charging cables</li>
        <li>Hygiene products</li>
        <li>Blankets</li>

      </ul>
    </li>

      <h6>Why do you want my résumé?</h6>

      First and foremost, MinneHack is a recruiting event. Our
      sponsors have paid top dollar to see <em>you</em>, the hackers!
      So submit your resume, stop by the sponsorship booths, and talk
      to our mentors and judges! Even if you're not in the market for
      a job right now, you will be someday; what better way to start a
      conversation than at MinneHack?
    </li>

    <li>
      <h6>What's the internet situation like?</h6>

      This year we are able to provide both wired and wireless
      internet! We recommend you bring a device compatible with
      ethernet, as the wi-fi at our venue cannot account for the load
      of hackers we attract. We will provide ethernet cables. If you
      need a converter, we have a few available on first-come
      first-serve basis, but we recommend you bring your own.
    </li>

    <li>
      <h6>Will you be providing transportation?</h6>

      As we get closer to the event, we will let you know whether a
      bus will be running through your school or not. If we aren't
      sending a bus your way, we will reimburse you for your travel
      expenses, up to $100. Just be sure to hold onto your receipts!
    </li>

    <li>
      <h6>What if I don't have enough experience to compete. Can I still attend?</h6>

      The most important thing is that you're there, have fun, and
      learn something. Go ahead and register and make the most out of
      it. It's completely free, so there's nothing to lose!
