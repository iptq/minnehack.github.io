    <h2>What is MinneHack?</h2>
    <p>
      MinneHack is a regional hackathon &endash; a software
      development competition. Most hackathons take place over a 24
      hour period and include any number of teams that are comprised
      of up to four students. Previous iterations of MinneHack
      (including our first annual hackathon, originally branded UHack)
      have attracted 200+ students from 14 colleges and 5 different
      states &endash; making it the largest hackathon in the Twin
      Cities! These students consist of motivated software engineers
      &endash; many of whom are eligible for recruiting.
